## Project Description
Having someone close to you with severe food allergies is never easy, spending countless times at the grocery store, scrutinizing every inch of the ingredients on the back of a product label becomes part of your life. At the beginning of the year, when the final project was announced, the goal was to come up with a project idea that could be used in everyday life and that would be related to aiding sufferers of food allergies. 

Allergy Scanner is a mobile application that can scan a barcode of a product whether it be at the grocery store or in your kitchen at home, notifying the user if the food they are about to purchase is free from any allergenic foods. This application would be beneficial for people with food allergies as well as family/friends of people with food allergies who want to keep them safe.

## Features
- Allow users to register an account, login and update their credentials.
- The application would give the user the opportunity to enter, update and delete their allergens. 
- Allow users to scan the barcode of a product of their choice and cross reference the result against the allergens selected.
- Allow users to favourite a scanned product.
- Allow users to view a list of their previous scans and access each scan individually.
